# Call Center Report Dashboard
## Project Objective
To analyze call center performance by evaluating call durations, customer satisfaction ratings, and purchase behaviors. The goal is to identify key factors impacting customer experience and optimize operational efficiency by improving response times and service quality.

## Dataset used
- <a href = ""> Dataset </a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the average call duration for different representatives?
- How does call duration impact customer satisfaction?
- What percentage of calls fall into each duration bucket (short, medium, long)?
- What is the overall customer satisfaction rating?
- Which representatives have the highest and lowest satisfaction scores?
- How does satisfaction vary based on call duration and purchase amount?
- Who are the top-performing representatives based on satisfaction ratings?
- What is the average handling time per representative?
- What is the average purchase amount per call?
- How does purchase behavior vary by call duration and satisfaction rating?
- Do longer calls lead to higher purchase amounts?
- Which age group has the highest satisfaction rating?
- How do satisfaction ratings vary by gender and city?
- Are there geographic trends in purchase amounts or call durations?

## Process
#### Data Collection & Import
- Gather raw call center data (Call number, Customer ID, Duration, Representative, Date, Purchase amount, Satisfaction rating, etc.).
- Import data into a BI tool (Excel) or a database for processing.
#### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Remove duplicate or incorrect entries.
- Standardize date formats and categorize call durations into buckets.
- Handle missing or inconsistent data values.
#### Data Transformation & Aggregation
- Calculate key metrics (average call duration, satisfaction score, total purchases, etc.).
- Create new columns if needed (e.g., duration buckets, customer segments).
- Aggregate data at different levels (daily, weekly, monthly).
#### Dashboard Design & Visualization
- Select key performance indicators (KPIs) based on business objectives.
- Use appropriate charts (bar charts for representative performance, line charts for trends, pie charts for satisfaction distribution, etc.).
- Add interactive filters (date range, representative, call duration, etc.).
#### Data Validation & Testing
- Cross-check dashboard results with raw data for accuracy.
- Ensure calculations and aggregations align with business goals.
- Get feedback from stakeholders for improvements.
#### Deployment & Monitoring
- Publish the dashboard on a BI tool or web platform.
- Schedule data refreshes for real-time insights.
- Continuously update and refine based on new data trends.

## Project Insight
- Call Duration & Satisfaction: Shorter calls (<2 mins) have a 4.7/5 satisfaction rating, while longer calls (>5 mins) drop to 3.2/5.
- Representative Performance: Top performer Rep R05 has a 4.8/5 rating, while the lowest, Rep R12, has 3.1/5, indicating a need for training.
- Overall Customer Satisfaction: The average satisfaction rating is 4.2/5, with 26-40-year-olds being the most satisfied (4.5/5).
- Sales & Purchase Behavior: Customers with high satisfaction (4.5+) spend $145 per call, while low-satisfaction customers (<3.5) spend only $90.
- Geographic Insights: Columbus has the highest satisfaction (4.6/5), while Cleveland has the lowest (3.8/5).
- Peak Call Times: The busiest hours are 10 AM – 12 PM, and Mondays see 25% more calls than other weekdays.
- Operational Improvement: Reducing call durations and optimizing staffing during peak hours can significantly enhance customer satisfaction and efficiency.
## Final Conclusion
- Call Duration Impact: Shorter calls result in higher customer satisfaction, indicating a need for faster issue resolution.
- Representative Performance: Variations in agent ratings highlight the need for targeted training to improve service quality.
- Customer Satisfaction Trends: Middle-aged customers (26-40 years) report the highest satisfaction, while younger customers require better engagement strategies.
- Sales & Customer Experience: Higher satisfaction leads to increased spending, emphasizing the importance of quality interactions.
- Geographic Differences: Customer satisfaction varies across cities, suggesting a need for localized service improvements.
- Operational Efficiency: Peak call times (10 AM – 12 PM) and high Monday call volumes require better staffing allocation for efficiency.
#### Action Plan:
- Implement training programs for underperforming representatives.
- Optimize call handling to reduce durations while maintaining service quality.
- Personalize engagement strategies for younger customers.
- Allocate resources efficiently during peak hours to improve response times.
